      <h1>Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>DELIVERY, CANCELLATION AND REFUND</strong></p>
      <p>
        No refund shall be processed once the Order has been placed and
        executed. However, if the User intends to cancel a successfully placed
        order before execution, the User is required to contact the customer
        care team within 1 (one) hour of making the payment, whereafter it is
        totally at the discretion of the Website whether to issue refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any technical delay or glitch reported in the Website during the
        processing of the request shall not be eligible for claiming refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        No refund shall be processed for the reason that incorrect information
        or data has been provided by You. The User agrees to be careful while
        providing any information to the Website and must re-check the
        information filled before clicking on “Submit”. The User can request for
        change in the incorrect information or data entered, provided the
        request for such change has been made with the customer care within 1
        (one) hour of execution of the service rendered by the service provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refund on a pro-rata basis may be considered for any delay in the
        activation of the subscription services.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that the display picture for the products listed for purchase
        by the User are for reference purposes only, and the Website will try to
        deliver the product ordered in an as-is condition as displayed on the
        Website. The User is advised to exercise discretion in such cases, and
        no refund shall be issued on such grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The refunds, if any, shall be processed after deduction of the
        transaction charges levied by the Bank and/or the Payment Gateway, to
        and fro cost of the shipping and/or courier charges (With regard to
        purchase of a product listed on the Website), customs duty (if levied)
        and/or any other charges that may have been incurred by the Website
        during processing and/or delivering the service, as applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case the Website or Payment gateway’s webpage, that is linked to the
        Website, is experiencing any server-related issues like ‘slow down’ or
        ‘failure’ or ‘session timeout’, the User shall, before initiating the
        second payment, check whether his/her Bank Account has been debited or
        not and accordingly resort to one of the following options:
      </p>
      <p>
        In case the Bank Account appears to be debited, ensure that you do not
        make the payment twice and immediately thereafter contact the Website
        via customer care to confirm payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case the Bank Account is not debited, the User may initiate a fresh
        transaction to make payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, refund for multiple payments, if any, even after the above
        precaution against the same order, shall be refunded in full without
        deduction of the transaction charges as mentioned above. The Website
        shall only retain the cost of one single order as intended to be placed
        by the User.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are orders that the Website is unable to accept and must
        cancel, the Website at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse
        or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever. Some situations may
        result in the order being cancelled and include, without limitation,
        non-availability of the service, inaccuracy, error in pricing
        information or other problems as identified. If the User’s order is
        cancelled after charges being paid against the said service, the said
        amount paid for booking shall be refunded.
