        <p><strong>MODERATION POLICY</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          This Moderation Policy governs your use of the Chatting, Audio Call,
          and Video Call features (collectively “Features”) on our various
          social media applications (collectively “Applications”). The
          Applications are operated by Trilo (hereinafter referred to as
          “Trilo”).
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          This Moderation Policy applies to all audio, video, and digital
          interactions, whether paid or unpaid, on the Applications.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          Use of the Features is subject to this Content Moderation Policy, and
          violations may result in removal of access to the Applications and
          forfeiture of monies without compensation or refund.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          No Active Moderation: Any social interactions occurring through the
          Features are not monitored, as they are private in nature. You
          acknowledge that you are aware of the unmoderated nature of
          discussions and that engagements with strangers carry risks. However,
          in the interest of safety, we may periodically use automated or
          AI-based tools to monitor interactions. An interaction violating our
          Policies will be terminated without compensation or refunds of any
          nature.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          Trilo does not conduct any background verification of Users or
          Streamers. Please read and follow the Terms of Service, Community
          Guidelines, and Privacy Policy while interacting with other Users and
          Streamers.
        </p>

        <p>
          No Responsibility and Liability: Trilo is not responsible for the
          actions of Users or Streamers who use the Features. Such actions are
          not representative of Trilo, its directors, employees, officers, or
          investors, and they do not take responsibility for any User or
          Streamer. Trilo reserves the right to terminate your access to the
          Platform if you violate this Policy, the Terms of Service, Community
          Guidelines, Privacy Policy, or applicable laws.

        <p>
          Being Civil: Interactions must be civil and polite, and within
          acceptable boundaries of interaction. Do not engage in behavior that
          is abusive, illegal, offensive, or unlawful. Do not use language that
          may be offensive or that invades the privacy of Users or Streamers.

        <p>
          No Stalking or Harassment: Users and Streamers are prohibited from
          harassing or stalking anyone online or offline. To understand the

          No Nudity: Nude or other similar unlawful Content is prohibited on the
