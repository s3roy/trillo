          Trilo (hereinafter “Trilo”) operates as a social media application.
          Trilo is classified as a Social Media Intermediary as defined under
          the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media
          Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (hereinafter the “Rules”) and has implemented
          the following policies and procedures to comply with the requirements
          of the Rules.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          Trilo’s Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Community Guidelines
          (collectively “Trilo Policies”) are available within the app in the
          Profile tab. Trilo informs users of any changes in the Policies at
          least once a calendar year. Additionally, Trilo notifies users at
          least once annually that non-compliance with the Policies may result
          in immediate termination of access or removal of non-compliant
          information, or both. Such notifications are provided via push
          notifications in the Important Notification tab.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          In compliance with the Rules, Trilo Policies specifically prohibit
          users from publishing content that:
        </p>
        <p>
          (i) invades another’s bodily privacy or is harmful or harassing based
          on gender, especially with regard to children;
        </p>
        <p>(ii) is patently false or misleading, while appearing as fact;</p>
        <p>
          (iii) impersonates, deceives, or is false with the intention of
          causing harm, wrongful loss, harassment, wrongful gain, or fraud;
        </p>
        <p>
          (iv) threatens the unity, integrity, defense, security, or sovereignty
          of India; or

          that falls within the above categories. Trilo enforces a strict No
          Nudity Policy, and any content or interactions containing nudity will
          be immediately removed or terminated as necessary.
